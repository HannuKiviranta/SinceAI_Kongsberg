# 🚢 COLREG Sound Signal Classifier

A robust, containerized Machine Learning system designed to detect and classify maritime sound signals according to the **International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs)**, specifically **Rules 34 & 35**.

This project uses a **Deep Learning (CNN + GRU)** architecture to identify critical navigation signals such as "Overtaking", "Altering Course", and "Not Under Command" directly from audio streams. It features an automated **Curriculum Learning** pipeline that trains on clean synthetic data before fine-tunes on noisy environments (wind, waves, engine noise) for real-world reliability.

## 🌟 Key Features

-   **Curriculum Learning Pipeline:** Automatically trains on clean data first to learn signal patterns, then introduces realistic background noise to improve robustness.
    
-   **Synthetic Data Generator:** Programmatically creates thousands of labeled training samples (`.wav`) by mixing raw horn blasts with environmental textures.
    
-   **Hybrid Model Architecture:** Combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for spectral feature extraction with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) for temporal sequence analysis.
    
-   **Dockerized Workflow:** Zero-dependency setup. A single command generates data, trains the model, and outputs a production-ready classifier.
    

## 🧠 Technical Architecture

The system processes audio in three distinct stages:

1.  **Preprocessing (The Ear):** Raw audio is converted into **Mel-Spectrograms**, visualizing the sound as an image (Time vs. Frequency).
    
2.  **Feature Extraction (CNN):** A Convolutional Neural Network scans the spectrogram to identify the "shape" of horn blasts and distinguish them from noise.
    
3.  **Sequence Recognition (GRU):** A Recurrent Neural Network analyzes the timing and order of the blasts (e.g., "Short-Short-Short" vs "Long-Short") to classify the COLREG signal.
